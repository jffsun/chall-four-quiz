# Challenge Four: Javascript Quiz

## Project Description

Challenge four's requirement was to built a fully functioning quiz web application with Javascript's Web APIs. This application functions correctly if the user is given a timed quiz which saves their score afterwards. The user should then be able to compare their score with past high scores. The timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals informs the user whether their selected answer for each question is correct or not and subtracts 5 seconds to the timer for each missed question.
